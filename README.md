# FJT
FJT is [immersion-bot](https://github.com/themoeway/immersion-bot) log command helper.

Why is this better than typing ".log <media type> <amount> <name>"? Because FJT can cache data, so you don't have to type the same thing over and over again.

At the moment it only works on wayland linux. It requires wl-clipboard.
